    <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.</p>

  <div class="text">
      <p>This is a timeline of the big moments in his life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1879:</strong> Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany</li>
            <li><strong>1884:</strong> Receives his first compass around this time, inspiring a lifelong quest to investigate mysteries of the natural world.</li>
            <li><strong>1889:</strong> Settles into a program of self-education at age 10 and begins reading as much about science as he can.</li>
            <li><strong>1894:</strong> Stays on in Munich to finish the school year after his parents move to Pavia, Italy.<br> Lasts only one term on his own and then follows his family to Italy.</li>
            <li><strong>1895:</strong> Attempts to skip high school by taking an entrance exam to the Swiss Polytechnic,<br> a top technical university, but fails the arts portion. His family sends him to the Swiss town of Aarau to finish high school.</li>
            <li><strong>1896:</strong> Graduates from high school at age 17 and enrolls at the ETH (the Federal Polytechnic School) in Zurich.</li>
            <li><strong>1898:</strong> Falls in love with Mileva Maric, a Serbian classmate at the ETH.</li>
            <li><strong>1900:</strong> Graduates from the ETH.</li>
            <li><strong>1901:</strong> Becomes a Swiss citizen and, unemployed, searches for work.</li>
            <li><strong>1902:</strong>  Einstein takes a job at the Swiss Patent Office.</li>
            <li><strong>1905:</strong> Publishes, at age 26, five groundbreaking papers, making this his "annus mirabilis," or miracle year. <br>One of the papers introduces his special theory of relativity and another <i>E = mc<sup>2</sup></i>.</li>
            <li><strong>1906:</strong> Continues working as an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.</li>
            <li><strong>1907:</strong> Begins applying the laws of gravity to his special theory of relativity.</li>
            <li><strong>1911:</strong> Moves with his family to Prague, where he is given a full professorship at the German University there. <br>Attends the invitation-only Solvay Conference in Brussels, the first world physics conference; he is the youngest physicist there.</li>
            <li><strong>1912:</strong> Moves with his family to Zurich, where he becomes a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH.</li>
            <li><strong>1913:</strong> Works on his new theory of gravity.</li>
            <li><strong>1914:</strong> Becomes director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin and professor of theoretical physics at the University of Berlin.</li>
            <li><strong>1915:</strong> Completes the general theory of relativity.</li>
            <li><strong>1917:</strong> Collapses from exhaustion and falls seriously ill. Nursed back to health by his cousin Elsa Löwenthal.<br> Publishes his first paper on cosmology.</li>
            <li><strong>1919:</strong> Marries Löwenthal. On May 29, a solar eclipse provides proof of the general theory of relativity.</li>
            <li><strong>1922:</strong> Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1921.</li>
            <li><strong>1927:</strong> Attends fifth Solvay Conference and begins developing the foundation of quantum mechanics with Niels Bohr.</li>
            <li><strong>1928:</strong> Begins pursuing his idea of a unified field theory.</li>
            <li><strong>1932:</strong> As a Jew, begins to feel the heat of Nazi Germany. Now, at 53, at the height of his fame.</li>
            <li><strong>1933:</strong> Sets sail with Löwenthal for the United States. <br>Settles with her in Princeton, New Jersey, where he assumes a post at the Institute for Advanced Study.</li>
            <li><strong>1939:</strong> Writes a famous letter to President Franklin Roosevelt not long after the start of World War II<br> that warns of the possibility of Germany's building an atomic bomb and urges nuclear research.</li>
            <li><strong>1940:</strong> Becomes an American citizen (retains his Swiss citizenship).</li>
            <li><strong>1955:</strong> Dies of heart failure on April 18.</li>
